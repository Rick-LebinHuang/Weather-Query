Hello, I am Lebin Huang (Rick). This is my simple weather query system project, which is developed based on the QT Creator framework using the C++ technology stack. Welcome to try it.
The executable file is located in "build-WeatherSystem-Desktop_Qt_5_15_2_MSVC2019_64bit-Debug".
Open the folder, then open the debug folder and find "WeatherSystem.exe" to run the program.
You can enter a city or postal code (the postal code is limited to Australia) in the input bar to query. 
If you find no changes, it means there is an issue with the city or postal code you entered.
Currently, this program implements the basic situation of querying cities, including weather description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 
However, there are also some areas for optimization, such as providing selectable cities in the input bar, changing the country of the postal codes that can be queried, and dynamic display of backgrounds and icons.
